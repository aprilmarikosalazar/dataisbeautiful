# Data is Beautiful
##### Welcome to my repo / visualization portfolio! This is here to showcase my journey into data visualization. I've always gawked at the original 'dataisbeautiful' (reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) since stumbling upon it in 2012. Here, my goal is to learn various methods to create stunning representations of complex data, all while telling a compelling and accurate story. A lot of my work comes from Professor Joanna Lankester's course.
###### Click around to explore my use of various tools, such as: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX, Python, R, RStudio, Tableau, etc. You will also find I integrate packages, such as: dplyr, ggplot2, pandas, seaborn, tidyverse, etc. Some of the projects are interactive and you can play with the code directly in Colab. One special project you can view here --> youtu.be/wtpZ4VsvJF4.
