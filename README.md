# Data is Beautiful
##### Welcome to my repo / visualization portfolio! This is here to showcase my journey into data visualization. I've always gawked at the original 'dataisbeautiful' (reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) since stumbling upon it in 2012. Here, my goal is to learn various methods to create stunning representations of complex data, all while telling a compelling and accurate story. A lot of my work comes from Professor Joanna Lankester's course.
###### Click around to explore my use of various tools, such as: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX, PyCharm, Python, R, RStudio, Tableau, VS Code, etc. You will also find I integrate R and Python packages, such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyverse, and pandas and seaborn, respectively. Some of the projects are interactive and you can play with the code directly in Colab. And here is one special project you can view here --> youtu.be/wtpZ4VsvJF4.
